### <a name="description"></a> Description:
I created an online art store using HTML, CSS & JS. It has a functional shop, cart and shipping page. I used what i have learned so far, stackoverflow and youtube. 
<hr>
The store has five pages. The index which is the landing/catalogue page, an about page, shop, cart and shipping/checkout page.

The landing/catalogue page displays what the store is selling.

And the about us page tells a story on how the store started and why it was started.

A cart which displays all the products the user has added to the cart including the price, quantity and name of the product.

Then lastly a checkout/shipping details page which allows the user to add a discount coupon, delivery option and a confirm order button which all modifies the final price which is displayed on checkout.
