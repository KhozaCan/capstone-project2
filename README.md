### <a name="description"></a> Description:
I created an online art store using HTML, CSS & JS. It has a functional shop, cart and shipping page. I used what i have learned so far, stackoverflow and youtube.

The project is important as it ties together all that I have learnt over the course of the bootcamp and puts all together in one big project (or online store in this case).

It contains a landing page with navigation to the various other pages (catalogue, cart and checkout). A catalogue displaying all the items the shop has to offer and alerts to the price of the cart.

A cart which displays all the products the user has added to the cart including the price, quantity and name of the product.

Then lastly a checkout/shipping details page which allows the user to add a discount coupon, delivery option and a confirm order button which all modifies the final price which is displayed on checkout.
